sway is the best wayland compositor and steam works perfectly on it, including grim dawn

sway package might not include `swaybg` but you need it


sway uses `foot` as the terminal editor. make a config file at `~/.config/foot/foot.ini` and add
`font=monospace:size=28` otherwise its too hard to read in 4k

sway process is a child of the bash process, but swaybar and swaybg appear to fork
