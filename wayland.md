Must haves
* Wayland
* stacking/floating

Nice to have
* Ideally as few processes as possible
* simple enough that it doesn't need a nixOS module to install or start. just packages

Some good choices
* labwc - very simple, one process, does not need config files to get started
* cosmic - very fully featured, pure Wayland in Rust, targets Vulkan. Modern as hell and the best choice, but it's so new that the packages don't work in NixOS
