use desktop as DIY router

step 1 - get online manually..which i've done a million times before
yellow ethernet cable is 1000mbps
wlan0 doesn't even show up in `ip link` if iwd is not running. that is unexpected
tp-link is 192.168.1.0/24
tp-link dhcp range is 100-199
done

step 2 - wifi needs to be in AP mode
