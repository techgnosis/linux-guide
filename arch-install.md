I think this is the minimal install of Arch that I want

# During install
base\
linux\
linux-firmware\
micro\
intel-ucode\
efibootmgr\
sudo

If I install sudo during the install then I never have to login as root

# Audio
pipewire\
pipewire-audio\
pipewire-alsa\
pipewire-pulse\
alsa-utils

pipewire-pulse is for Steam games

# Wayland
vulkan-radeon\
niri\
alacritty\
fuzzel\
ttf-liberation\
xwayland-satellite\
xdg-desktop-portal-wlr

# Tools
flatpak
