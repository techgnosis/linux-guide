`nix-env --install` adds to nix store and makes a new user environment/generation pair.
`nix-env --uninstall` only makes a new user environment/generation pair. You have to garbage collect to remove from the store

user environments
* generated by `nix-env`
* contain activated packages
* Directories full of symlinks

generations
* triggered by `nix-env`
* exist in the profiles directory
* points to a user env

profile
* user facing
* friendly name
* points to a generation



the abstractions exist due to nix's inherent multi-user nature. when nix-env is run, a new generation is built off the generation pointed to by the users profile. so if bob installs `micro` it will install on top of the generation that he is using and not effect sally

Bob->10
Sally->8
Bob runs `nix-env --install micro`
Generation is created called `bob-generation-11`
Bob->11
Sally->8
