When you are not in a graphical environment, such as right after you log in, you are in a "TTY" and you are probably interacting with a program called `agetty`

When you are in a graphical environment, you have a lot of options for terminals. The major desktop environments (DEs) come with their own terminals, but outside of the DEs there are a few that stand out as the most popular:
* foot
* alacritty
* kitty

foot is purely a Wayland terminal so if you don't want to have an Xwayland process running then foot is the name of the game. I don't actually know if alacritty and kitty use Wayland or not.

Unless you are a serious power user, you will not likely notice a difference in any of them.
